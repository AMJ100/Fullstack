            <li>300g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>200g unsalted butter, softened</li>

            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees. Lightly grease loaf pan</li>
            <li>Combine the poppy seeds and milk in a bowl and set aside for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Combine the caster sugar and 185g of the butter untill light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs. Fold in the flour gradually, alternate with the poppy seed and milk mix. Finally stir in lemon rind. Alternatively add the ingredients to an electric mixer. Beat on high for 5 minutes until the mixture is pale and thick.

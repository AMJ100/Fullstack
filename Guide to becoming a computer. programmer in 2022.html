            What <i>exactly</i> is a computer programmer? Computer programmers write code. They <br> write code to design programs. This may sound vague, but computer programming is a <br> vast field with many different specializations. In order to effectively include all of the <br> database managers, web developers, systems analysts, and application devs, it is easier <br> to group them under the umbrella of “computer programmers.”
        </p>
        <p>
            If you love writing code, computer programming might be for you. In this article we'll <br> discuss steps it takes to become a computer programmer. We'll break down each step <br> in detail so you'll have a better understanding of what the work itself will look like. <br> You may have seen some of our longer guides on finding a job in the tech industry like <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer" target="_blank">How <br> to become a full-stack developer</a> or <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/data-engineer-career" target="_blank">How to become a data engineer.</a> This article will <br> cover similar steps to these guides, but we'll dive a little deeper into the weeds of each one.

            Coders don't necessarily have to be professionals to be considered computer <br> programmers. There are plenty of hobbyists out there that, according to our definition <br> of computer programming, make the grade. Even so, we'll focus on the path to finding a <br> computer programming career.

        To the uninitiated, computer science and software engineering describe two very <br> similar disciplines. In reality, these two fields are completely different. Computer <br> science is centered around learning general computational principles and applying <br> them to a range of fields like machine learning, database management, and <br> information security. Software engineering on the other hand is engineering oriented <br> and revolves around the practical skills necessary to design, develop, and maintain <br> software systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly, the role of a computer programmer and a software engineer are quite <br> different. As previously mentioned, programmers typically work in a more specialized <br> area of the development process. They are responsible for writing code and building <br> software. Software engineers are still very much involved in the development process, <br> but they are more likely to oversee broader areas as well. Software engineers are often <br> responsible for conception of an idea, troubleshooting, and implementation as well as <br> development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Coders and computer programmers occupy a unique position in the job market. It is <br> common for large high-paying organizations to not require a computer programming <br> degree or other bespoke education requirements. As long as you present the hiring <br> team with a resume and portfolio of projects you've worked on, and are able to pass a <br> technical interview, many companies don't care if you <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-programmer-with-no-degree" target="_blank">don't have a degree.</a>
    </p>

<h2 id="Second"> What kind of programmer do you want to be?</h2> <br>
<img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/6476200228945920/image/download/6657692645195776" width="100px" height="20%" alt="">

    <p>There are so many different flavors of programming that if you <br> love to code, it may be daunting to determine what you want to <br> pursue as a career. The best way to find out what you like to try <br> as much as you can </p>

    <h3>Just a few types of programmer jobs to look into are:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Software application development</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/beginner-guide-to-web-dev" target="_blank"> Web development</a> </li>
        <li>Front end, back-end, and full-stack</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/exploring-data-science-with-microsofts-applied-ai-engineer" target="_blank">Data science</a> and <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/machine-learning-for-data-science" target="_blank"> machine learning </a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/database-design-tutorial" target="_blank"> Database administrator </a></li>
        <li>System design</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Each of these disciplines require slightly different skills. Seek out as much as you can <br> with respect to all the different fields, and remember that nothing is set in stone. If, in <br> your education, you find that web development is not what you find interesting and <br> would prefer to spend your time training artificial intelligence and studying <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/neural-networks-python" target="_blank">neural <br> networks</a>, allow yourself the the time to pivot. The world of computer programming is <br> so diverse that it can be hard to find a niche, but it is very rewarding once you settle.
